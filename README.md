This smart contract was written for an assignment with the following specification:

The contract should allow two players (A, B) to play a game of Morra at any point in time. Each player
picks a number between 1-5 and also guesses which number their fellow player has picked. They
both show their hands and, in case only player A guesses correctly, A wins and is rewarded x
Ether, where x is the sum of the numbers both players picked (similarly if B wins). After the game
ends, users should be able to initiate a new game on the same contract.

An analysis of the contract in terms of security and gas costs was also required.
